<div id="about">
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> I'm Nicholas C. Hung. ("syncopika" online) Nice to meet you! :D </h2>
<p> I love making music and other useful things (like <a href="nchipodcase.html"; a style="color:white;">cardboard iPod touch cases</a>??)</p>
<p> Ultimately, I'd like to utilize my analytical skills developed through my college coursework in biology in some industry other than scientific research. But I'd also like to be a professional composer/arranger, graphic/visual artist and trumpet player! I definitely want to be a well-rounded individual, knowledge-wise.</p>
<p> I'm Chinese, but my Mandarin (&#22283;&#35486; / &#26222;&#36890;&#35441;) is bad because my parents have mainly spoken in English to me my whole life (very rarely did Mandarin come up). Oh well, I'm learning! </p>
<p> Among other things, I'm interested in Chinese culture, as well as Japanese culture and the Japanese language, partially because their use of Chinese characters is particularly fascinating. I also want to know more about ancient and Middle Chinese. They're a lot different from Chinese languages we know today! </p>
<p> A lot of my time is spent composing/arranging/transcribing music, and I have a strong affinity and admiration for Japanese anime BGM and anisong (i.e. opening/ending themes for anime), but also film scores in general. </p>
<p> I also very much enjoy trying to improve in my <a href="nchartgallery.html"; style="color:white;">visual art skills</a>, and learning/programming in Python (it's tough!).
<!-- if you really want to know a bit more how I feel: <p> thanks to my college experience (no really, thank you college!), I sort of abhor science now, mainly biology. :< But I want to use my brain to do some amazing things maybe not science-related.</p> -->
<p> I also happen to like the color green.</p>

<div id="greeting">
<h2> welcome! &#27489;&#39154;! </h2>
<p> this is my website! </p>
<p>I hope you like it, or at least find something interesting here. </p>
<p> thanks for visiting! </p>
<p><b><em> Where did the name "syncopika" come from? </em></b></p>
<p> well, I really like syncopated rhythms, and I like Pikachu. so I combined the two. I feel bad deriving my name from "Pikachu" though, but it's a super unique name! (apologies to Nintendo and Pokemon)</p>
<p> I guess you could also look at it like this: "syncop-" from syncopation and "-ika" as in the Japanese word for squid. Squids are cool too! (though nautiluses (-li?) are cooler mollusks I think) </p>
