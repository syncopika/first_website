mywebsite1.0
============
The components shown in the html and css folders are the core pieces of my website. I started building this website a bit less than 2 months ago. 
  
hopefully I will update this too as I continue to try to improve my website and apply PHP maybe.

Hi self from the past!  
  
I have some good news and bad news...  
  
The good news is that you have been using Tumblr to make a new website, which looks better!  
The bad news is...this "mywebsite1.0" is now defunct and offline.  
But that's okay, because Tumblr is much easier to use anyway. ^_^  
  
Happy coding!
